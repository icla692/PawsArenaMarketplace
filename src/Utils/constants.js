One of the kitties - Zack - walks on the sidewalk minding his own business, when all of a sudden a book drops from a window and opens in front of him.Zack goes through the book and he finds the answer to a question that he always had - Why are there different colored kitties? Why arenâ€™t we all the same?As soon as he finds the answer, he runs to a dark alley and gathers all his friends to tell them about the long forgotten 7 kitty Kingdoms and how each kitty comes from one of the Kingdoms, ruled by 7 kings and 7 queens, and overseen by 7 gods. What Kingdom will you choose?",
